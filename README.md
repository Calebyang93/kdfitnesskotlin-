Import maven commands for testing and running the kotlin project with maven commands:
mvn commands 
Maven (mvn) commands are used to interact with the Maven build automation tool for Java projects. These commands typically execute specific goals or phases within the Maven build lifecycle.
Common Maven Commands:
mvn clean: Removes all files generated by the previous build, typically found in the target directory.
mvn compile: Compiles the project's source code.
mvn test-compile: Compiles the test source code.
mvn test: Runs the unit tests for the project.
mvn package: Compiles, tests, and packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
mvn install: Packages the project and installs the artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR) into the local Maven repository, making it available for other local projects.
mvn deploy: Copies the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects. 
mvn validate: Validates the project's structure and configuration (POM file).
mvn site: Generates project documentation.
mvn archetype:generate: Creates a new project from a predefined archetype (template).
mvn dependency:tree: Displays the project's dependency tree, showing all direct and transitive dependencies.
mvn --version (or mvn -v): Displays the installed Maven version and related environment information.
mvn clean install: A common combination that first cleans the project and then builds and installs it into the local repository.
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true: Packages the project while skipping the execution of tests.
mvn spring-boot:run: running a spring boot application. 
Checking full stack trace of errors, re-run maven commands with -e switch.
